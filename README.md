# Web App Overview

The app employs a trained LightGBM model to predict taxi demands for the next hour. Data from January 2022 onwards is stored in a Feature Store on HopsWorks, and new data is fetched every 60 minutes using GitHub Actions.

The web app serves as an interface to visualize real-time predictions, rendered as a time series plot. It offers filters for location selection and provides monitoring of key performance metrics.

# Feature/Training/Inference Pipelines
[(Back to top)](#fti-pipelines)

The MLOps strategy adopted here is built upon the FTI (Feature, Training, Inference) architecture. This architecture was proposed by Jim Dowling (CEO and Co-Founder of HopsWorks) and provides a unified structure that describes both batch ML systems and real-time ML systems. It does so primarily by categorizing operations into three well-defined and separate pipelines.

A significant part of the development process is prototyping and experimentation. In this project, Jupyter notebooks have been employed extensively for this purpose. Here's a breakdown of the notebooks corresponding to each of the FTI pipelines:

## ðŸ“Š Feature Pipeline

The feature pipeline systematically fetches, transforms, and stores refined time-series taxi data, making it ready for machine learning model consumption and other analytics purposes.

| **Notebook** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| [**11_backfill_feature_store.ipynb**](https://github.com/TomaIjatomi/taxi_demand_predictor/blob/main/notebooks/11_backfill_feature_store.ipynb) | The notebook downloads and consolidates raw taxi ride data from a specified range of years, transforms this data into a time-series format, and then uploads it to a centralized feature store. |
| [**12_simulated_feature_pipeline.ipynb**](https://github.com/TomaIjatomi/taxi_demand_predictor/blob/main/notebooks/12_feature_pipeline.ipynb) | The notebook fetches a batch of raw data simulating recent production information by adjusting historical data, transforms it into a time-series format, and subsequently populates a feature store with this data. |

## ðŸŽ¯ Training Pipeline

The Training Pipeline involves setting up data infrastructure, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to create a robust machine learning model.

| **Notebook** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| [**13_model_training_pipeline.ipynb**](https://github.com/TomaIjatomi/taxi_demand_predictor/blob/main/notebooks/13_model_training_pipeline.ipynb) | This notebook establishes a training pipeline, creating a feature view, transforming time-series data into features and targets, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and tuning a LightGBM model using Optuna. |

## ðŸ¤– Inference Pipeline

The Inference Pipeline is structured to retrieve the latest data, process it, utilize a pre-trained model for prediction, and store the outputs efficiently for downstream applications.


| **Notebook** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| [**14_inference_pipeline.ipynb**](https://github.com/TomaIjatomi/taxi_demand_predictor/blob/main/notebooks/14_inference_pipeline.ipynb) | This notebook fetches recent data, predicts taxi demand using LightGBM, and saves predictions to a feature store. |


For those interested in the granular details and the intricate processes behind each pillar of the architecture, the notebooks serve as a comprehensive guide. They offer code, visualizations, and explanations that provide clarity on the MLOps strategies employed in the project.
